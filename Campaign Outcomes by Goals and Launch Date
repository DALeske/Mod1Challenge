# Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Goals

## Overview of Project
The project is a request from Louise (last name unknown), who has successfully raised funds for her play "Fever".  At Louise's request, I have been asked to compile a report of other campaigns and their outcomes based on the goal of funding and when the campaigns were launched. Based on the analysis, Louise may consider whether she has raised enough money for her play, and if so, when would be the optimal time to launch her play.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize outcomes of campaigns worldwide based on two different approaches: 
1) The outcomes of all campaign types worldwide based on the month of the year they were launched.
2) The outcomes of all plays worldwide based on the funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges
Data from Kickstarters worldwide was used for all analyzes. As the outomces of interest was for all completed studies, data for live campaigns were excluded. A subset of the data was created ("Completed" in Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx).
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the analysis of outcomes based on launch dates, data from the theater campaign category (including all subcategories) classified as successful, failed, or canceled were included. Data from campaigns that were active (live) at the time of this report were excluded. The analysis provides a look at the absolute number of campaigns classified as successfull, failed, or canceled for the month of the year they were launched. Data is presented in tablur form and as a line graph.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For the analysis of outcomes based on funding goals, data from all plays worldwide classified as successful, failed, or canceled were included. Data from plays that were active (live) at the time of this report were excluded. The analysis provides a summary of outcomes by funding goals.  Funding goals were categorized in bins of incraseig dollar amounts. Counts for each outcome category at each level of funding goal are presented. Outcomes are also presented as a percetage of the total number of projects at each funding goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No particular challenges were encountered during the analysis. Although not affecting the data, the presentation of the pivot chart was cluttered with the pivot buttons. THe solution was a quick Google search to find how to remove thge Pivot buttons from the chart. I did notice that the top category for the outcomes based on funding goals was non-inclusive of $50,000. I therefore changed the last category to, "50000 or Greater."

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
At first glance my two conclusions would be 1) launch in May through July and 2) Do not launch in December. However, looking at the data closer, the success rate of all campaigns overall is about 61%, which means that Louise can be fairly confident that launching her play at any time of the year is likley to produce a similar success rate, with perhaps the exception of December, which has a relatively low success rate and could be considered an outlier. I would therefore update my conclusion of the data to, launch at any time of teh year except December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The simple conclusion is that a funding goal below $15,000 appears to be predictive of a successful outcome. However, campaigns funded in the $35,000 to $45,000 range appear to have good success as well. Above $45,000, the liklihood of failure is high.  Setting your funding goal too high apepars to be predictinve of failure. It is possible that there is an interaction between campaign type and funding goal in terms of success, which may explain the two ranges of success. Any interaction makes it difficult to interpret into a single conclusion that covers all scenarios.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A limitation of the dataset is that there are relatively few campaigns with funding goals above $15,000, making conclusions about any association bwetween funding goals and outcomes difficult above $15,000. A limitation of the outomes by launch date analysis is that the data are shown in absolute numbers, which gives the appearance that May is clearly the best time to launch a campaign. When looking at outcome as a percent of the overall number of campaigns launching per month, the average success rate is 61% +/- 4%. A more appropriate analysis would be to look at the outcomes as a percentage for each month. Another limitation is that the true failed rate is likely higher than what is reported because of misclassification. The canceled category is almost certainly not a success, and so it may be more appropriate to create a new dichotomous success/failure outcome which combines failed and canceled.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I think it would be appropriate to have an additional chart of outcome by launch date that graphs outcome as a percentage of the total nuber of campaigns launched each month. Currently, the graph shows a large peak during May, but that peak will be greatly reduced when looking at the percentages. GIven the low number of campaigns with funding goals above $15,000, I would like to see an additional table and corresponding line graph with the top funding goal category of "15000 and greater".
